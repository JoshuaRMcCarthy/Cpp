Main.cpp, Model.cpp, Tranlator.cpp, FileProccessor.cpp

None that I know of so far, maybe poor error catching and handling

Used Chatgpt to help explain minor errors that I was having, didn't write any code for me, but did recommend the substr() function to me

To compile: g++ *.cpp -o e.exe
To run: ./A1.exe input.txt output.html (I provided test.txt which is the example you showed in slack)
